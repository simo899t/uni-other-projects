Integrals over Non-Rectangular Regions

R
We can define R f dA for other shapes (triangles, circles, etc.) by
enclosing R in a rectangle and summing over subrectangles inside R.

Think of how T deforms subsets of D ∗ rather than the graph.
Image set:

Injective / surjective

One-to-one
T is one-to-one on D ∗ if T (u, v ) = T (u ′ , v ′ ) implies (u, v ) = (u ′ , v ′ ).

Onto
T is onto D if for every (x, y ) ∈ D there exists (u, v ) with
T (u, v ) = (x, y ).

Theorem (linear map)
If A is 2 × 2 matrix with det A ̸= 0 and T (u) = Au, then T maps
