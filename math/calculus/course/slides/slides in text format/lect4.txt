Graph of a Function

Definition
Let f : U ⊂ Rn → R. The graph of f is the subset of Rn+1 given by
(x1 , . . . , xn , f (x1 , . . . , xn )).
n = 1: graph is a curve in R2 .
n = 2: graph is a surface in R3 .
n = 3: graph is a hypersurface in R4

Example: Graph of f (x, y ) = x 2 + y 2
We plot the points. For example, we plot (1, 2, 5) because f(1, 2) = 5.
Then, we connect the points corresponding to the rows and columns in the
table. This gives us a wire-frame picture of the graph. As we refine the
grid, we get a surface called a paraboloid

Observe that if x is held fixed and y is allowed to vary, the graph dips
down and then goes back up, just like the entries in the rows of the table.

Cross Section

Definition
For f (x, y ), a cross-section is obtained by holding one variable fixed and
letting the other vary.

Graphically, it is the intersection of the surface with a plane x = c or
y = c.

Cross Sections in Rn

Definition
Let f : Rn → R and x = (x1 , . . . , xn ). Fix some variables xi = ai for
i ∈ I ⊂ {1, . . . , n}. The resulting function of the remaining variables is the
cross section:
g (xj : j ∈
/ I ) = f (x1 , . . . , xn )

with xi = ai fixed.

Dimension of cross section: n − |I |

Linear Functions of Several Variables

Definition
A function f : Rn → R is linear if it can be written as
f (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = c + m1 x1 + m2 x2 + · · · + mn xn ,
where c, m1 , . . . , mn are constants.
The graph of a linear function in n variables is an n-dimensional
hyperplane in Rn+1 .
Linear functions satisfy the superposition principle:
f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y),

Example when n = 2

A convenient formula
If a plane has slope m in the x-direction, has slope n in the y -direction,
and passes through the point (x0 , y0 , z0 ), then its equation is
z = z0 + m(x − x0 ) + n(y − y0 ).

Limit
Definition
Let f : Rn → R and a = (a1 , . . . , an ). We say
lim f (x) = L

x→a

if f (x1 , . . . , xn ) is as close to L as we please whenever the distance from
the point (x1 , . . . , xn ) to the point (a1 , . . . , an ) is sufficiently small.
1

x → a means x approaches a but is not equal to a.

2

The limit does not exist if no such L exists.

3

The limit laws from Lect 2 on addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, composition can be extended naturally to functions of several
variables.

Limit (ε-δ Definition)
Definition
Let f : Rn → R and a = (a1 , . . . , an ). We say
lim f (x) = L

x→a

if for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
0 < ∥x − a∥ < δ

=⇒

|f (x) − L| < ε.

As x gets arbitrarily close to a, f (x) gets arbitrarily close to L.
p
Recall ∥x − a∥ = (x1 − a1 )2 + · · · + (xn − an )2 .
The condition 0 < ∥x − a∥ ensures we consider points other than a
itself.

Continuity
Definition
f is continuous at a if
lim f (x) = f (a).

A function is continuous on a region U in Rn if it is continuous at each
point in U. There is no break in the graph of f !
Using the limit laws, one can show that for functions of several variables,
the following are continues

products of continuous functions

Partial Derivatives Intuition

Let’s make the intuition more precise...
1

Along y = 1, consider u(x) = T (x, 1).

2

By definition,
u ′ (2) = lim

h→0

T (2 + h, 1) − T (2, 1)
.
h

Then u ′ (2) measures rate of change of T in x direction at (2, 1).
3

Denote u ′ (2) as Tx (2, 1). Approximate Tx (2, 1) with h = 1.

Estimate rate of change in y direction.

Definition of Partial Derivatives

Partial derivatives of f at (a, b)
For all points at which the limit exist, we define the partial derivatives at
the point (a, b) by
f (a + h, b) − f (a, b)
h
f (a, b + h) − f (a, b)
fy (a, b) = lim

Tangent Plane
Seeing a plane when we zoom in at a point tells us (provided the plane is
not vertical) that f (x, y ) is closely approximated near that point by a
linear function, L(x, y ).
The graph of the function z = L(x, y ) is the tangent plane.

z = f (a, b) + fx (a, b)(x − a) + fy (a, b)(y − b)

Example
Let f (x, y ) = x 2 + y 2 and call the tangent plane you computed at (3,4)
L(x, y ). We define the error function
E (x, y ) = f (x, y ) − L(x, y ).
1

The error near (3,4) is given by E (3 + h, 4 + k) where h, k are small.

2

What is the distance between (3 + h, 4 + k) and (3, 4)?

Compare |E (3 + h, 4 + k)| with h2 + k 2 .

Local linearity

Tangent Plane Approximation
For (x, y ) near (a, b):
f (x, y ) ≈ L(x, y ) = f (a, b) + fx (a, b)(x − a) + fy (a, b)(y − b)
Error behavior: If f has continuous second derivatives, then

f (x, y ) − L(x, y ) = O ∥(x − a, y − b)∥2 .
That is, the error is proportional to the square of the distance from (x, y )
to (a, b).
