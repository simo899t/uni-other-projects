Limit (ε-δ Definition)

Definition
Let f : Rn → R and a = (a1 , . . . , an ). We say
lim f (x) = L

x→a

if for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
0 < ∥x − a∥ < δ

=⇒

|f (x) − L| < ε.

As x gets arbitrarily close to a, f (x) gets arbitrarily close to L.
Approaching a point a can occur along infinitely many paths:

Continuity
Definition
f is continuous at a if
lim f (x) = f (a).

x→a

A function is continuous on a region U in Rn if it is continuous at each
point in U. There is no break in the graph of f !
Using the limit laws, one can show that for functions of several variables,
the following are continues
1

sums of continuous functions

2

products of continuous functions

3

compositions of continuous functions

4

quotient of two continuous functions wherever the denominator
function is nonzero.

Introduction to Partial Derivatives

Imagine an unevenly heated thin rectangular metal plate lying in the
xy -plane. Temperature at (x, y ) is T (x, y ).

How does T vary near the point (2, 1)?

Partial Derivatives Intuition

Let’s make the intuition more precise...
1

Along y = 1, consider u(x) = T (x, 1).

2

By definition,
u ′ (2) = lim

h→0

T (2 + h, 1) − T (2, 1)
.
h

Then u ′ (2) measures rate of change of T in x direction at (2, 1).
3

Denote u ′ (2) as Tx (2, 1). Approximate Tx (2, 1) with h = 1.

Estimate rate of change in y direction.

Tangent Plane
Seeing a plane when we zoom in at a point tells us (provided the plane is
not vertical) that f (x, y ) is closely approximated near that point by a
linear function, L(x, y ).
The graph of the function z = L(x, y ) is the tangent plane.

z = f (a, b) + fx (a, b)(x − a) + fy (a, b)(y − b)

Example
Let f (x, y ) = x 2 + y 2 and call the tangent plane you computed at (3,4)
L(x, y ). We define the error function
E (x, y ) = f (x, y ) − L(x, y ).

The error near (3,4) is given by E (3 + h, 4 + k) where h, k are small.

What is the distance between (3 + h, 4 + k) and (3, 4)?

Local linearity

Tangent Plane Approximation
For (x, y ) near (a, b):
f (x, y ) ≈ L(x, y ) = f (a, b) + fx (a, b)(x − a) + fy (a, b)(y − b)
Error behavior: If f has continuous second derivatives, then

f (x, y ) − L(x, y ) = O ∥(x, y ) − (a, b)∥2 .
That is, the error is proportional to the square of the distance from (x, y )
to (a, b).

Question

Suppose f (x, y ) is an arbitrary function. How would you compute its rate
of change at P = (a, b) in the direction of the unit vector u = u1 i + u2 j?
For h > 0, consider the point Q = (a + hu1 , b + hu2 )
The displacement from P is hu.
Since ∥u∥ = 1, the distance between P, Q is h.
The average rate of change at P is thus
Change in f
f (a + hu1 , b + hu2 ) − f (a, b)

Distance between P, Q

Taking the limit as h → 0 gives the instantaneous rate of change.
