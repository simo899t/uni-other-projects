Functions

Definition
A function is a rule that takes numbers from a set A and assigns them a
unique number in a set B.
The set A is called the domain.
The range of f is the set of points in B that are hit by f .
Input is called the independent variable, output the dependent
variable.
The graph of f is the set of points (x, f (x)) in the xy -plane.

Properties of functions

Remarks
For a function f
for every x in the domain, f (x) is uniquely defined
for every y in the range, there exists x (not necessarily unique) such
that f (x) = y .

Linear Functions

Definition
A function is linear if its slope is constant. Equivalently, any linear
function can be written as
y = f (x) = mx + c
where m is the slope and c is the intercept
Remarks
1

Slope is rise over run, i.e., ∆y
∆x

2

Intercept is the value of f (0), i.e., c = f (0).

Proportionality

Definitions
We say that y is directly proportional to x if there is a non-zero
constant k such that
y = kx
We say that y is inversely proportional to x if there is a non-zero
constant k such that
k
y=
x
In either case, k is called the constant of proportionality.

number) exponents:

of the polynomial.

Asymptotes

Definitions
If f (x) approaches a finite number L as x goes to ∞ (or x goes to
−∞), then y = L is called a horizontal asymptote.
If f (x) goes to ∞ (or −∞) as x approaches a finite number K from
one side or the other, then x = K is called a vertical asymptote.

Exponential Growth Equations

Definition
P(t) is an exponential function of t if
P(t) = P0 at ,
where P0 is the initial quantity and a is the factor by which P(t) changes
when t increases by 1.
Remarks
If a > 1, we have exponential growth. If 0 < a < 1, we have
exponential decay.

The standard exponential function is
exp(x) = e x .
Notice that e is defined as the limit of a function of n as n approaching
infinity. We will discuss in details what does this mean in the next lecture.

Inverse functions

Definitions
For a function f : X → Y , its inverse f −1 : Y → X sends each element
y ∈ Y to the unique element x ∈ X such that f (x) = y .
The inverse of f , denoted f −1 (x), is a function that undoes the
operation of f .
f −1 exists if and only if f is one-to-one.
Two functions f and g are inverses if f (g (x)) = x and g (f (x)) = x
Graphically: reflection over y = x

Logarithms

Definition
If f (x) = ax , we define the logarithm function to be the inverse of f . In
other words

Examples
log(x)
If f (x) = 10x , then we define the logarithm base 10 of x to be f −1 (x). In
other words
log10 x = c ⇔ 10c = x.
Often, we leave off the 10 and just write log x.

ln(x)
If f (x) = e x , then we define the natural logarithm of x to be f −1 (x). In
other words
loge x = c ⇔ e c = x.
It is most often written loge x = ln x.

Definition of a Limit

lim f (x) = L

x→c

(In words: “the limit as x goes to c of f (x) equals L.”)
x → c means x approaches c but is not equal to c.
limx→c f (x) does not exist if no such L exists.

Intuitive Definition
if f (x) gets as close to L as we want by taking x sufficiently close to c

Formal Definition
For any ϵ > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x − c| < δ then
|f (x) − L| < ϵ.
