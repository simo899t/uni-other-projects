Definition
We say limx→c f (x) = L if we can get f (x) as close to L as we want by
taking x sufficiently close to c (but x ̸= c).
Formally, for any ϵ > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x − c| < δ then
|f (x) − L| < ϵ.

Definition
f is continuous at x = c if
lim f (x) = f (c)

x→c

f is continuous on [a, b] if continuous at every point in [a, b].

Definition
The derivative of a function at a point x = a is, rate of change of f at a,
defined as
f (a + h) − f (a)
f ′ (a) = lim
h→0
h
If this limit exists, f is differentiable at a.

Definition
The second derivative of a function f is the derivative of the derivative
function of f .

Intermediate Value Theorem
If f continuous on [a, b] and k between f (a) and f (b), there exists c s.t.
f (c) = k.

Mean Value Theorem
If f is continuous on a ≤ x ≤ b and differentiable on a < x < b, then
there exists a number c, with a < c < b, such that
f ′ (c) =

f (b) − f (a)
b−a

In other words, f (b) − f (a) = f ′ (c)(b − a).
Why is f not assumed to be differentiable at x = a or x = b?

Theorem
1

If f ′ (x) > 0 on an interval, then f (x) is increasing on that interval.

2

If f ′ (x) < 0 on an interval, then f (x) is decreasing on that interval.

3

If f ′ (x) = 0 on an interval, then f (x) is constant on that interval.

Theorem
1

3

If f ′′ > 0 on an interval, then f ′ is increasing over that interval, so the
graph of f is concave up.
If f ′′ < 0 on an interval, then f ′ is decreasing over that, so the graph
of f is concave down.
If f ′′ = 0 on an interval, then f ′ is constant on that interval, so the
graph of f is a straight line (linear).

Careful with the converse statements: ≥, ≤ instead of >, <.

Tangent Line Approximation
Suppose f is differentiable at a. Then, for values of x near a, the tangent
line approximation of f (x) is
f (x) ≈ f (a) + f ′ (a)(x − a)
The expression f (a) + f ′ (a)(x − a) is called the local linearization of f
near x = a.
The error, E (x), defined by E (x) = f (x) − f (a) − f ′ (a)(x − a), can be
approximated near x = a by
E (x) ≈

The First Derivative Test
Let x0 be a critical point of a continuous function f .
If f ′ changes from positive to negative at x0 , then f has a local
maximum.
If f ′ changes from negative to positive at x0 , then f has a local
minimum.
True or False? If f ′ (x0 ) = 0, then f has a local max or min at x0 . Explain.

The First Derivative Test
Let x0 be a critical point of a continuous function f .
If f ′ changes from positive to negative at x0 , then f has a local
maximum.
If f ′ changes from negative to positive at x0 , then f has a local
minimum.
True or False? If f ′ (x0 ) = 0, then f has a local max or min at x0 . Explain.
Important: All local extrema occur either at the end points of the domain
or at the critical points. But not all critical points are local extrema.

The Second Derivative Test:
Let x0 be a critical point of a continuous function f .
If f ′ (x0 ) = 0 and f ′′ (x0 ) > 0 then f has a local minimum at x0 .
If f ′ (x0 ) = 0 and f ′′ (x0 ) < 0 then f has a local maximum at x0 .
If f ′ (x0 ) = 0 and f ′′ (x0 ) = 0 then the test is inconclusive.

Local vs. Global Extrema

A global maximum of f is the greatest value of f over its domain
(or a specified interval).
A global minimum is the least value of f over its domain (or a
specified interval).
Local extrema only describe behavior near a point, while global
extrema compare values over the entire interval/domain.

the global extrema?

Find the critical points of f in (a, b).

2

Evaluate f at the critical points and endpoints a, b.

Extreme Value Theorem

Theorem
If f is continuous on a closed finite interval [a, b], then f is guaranteed to
have both a global maximum and a global minimum on that interval.
Endpoints a and b are possible locations for global extrema.
Critical points in (a, b) are also candidates.

Let us draw the graph of g (x) = x1 . Does g have a global maximum
over the interval 0 < x ≤ 1?

over the interval 0 ≤ x < ∞?

Points in Rn are vectors.

Definition
A vector a ∈ Rn is an ordered n-tuple of real numbers
a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , an )

origin.

where θ is the angle between the vectors (generalized from 3D).
Algebraic:
v · w = v1 w1 + v2 w2 + · · · + vn wn

Multivariate functions

Definition
A function of n variables is a function whose domain is a subset A of Rn
and whose range is a subset B of R.
The reason we say “n variables” is simply that we regard the coordinates
of a point x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ A as n variables, and f (x) = f (x1 , . . . , xn )
depends on these variables.
