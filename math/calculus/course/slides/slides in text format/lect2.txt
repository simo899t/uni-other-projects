Definition of Limit

Definition
We say
lim f (x) = L

x→c

if we can get f (x) as close to L as we want by taking x sufficiently close to
c (but x ̸= c).
Formally, for any ϵ > 0, there is a δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x − c| < δ then
|f (x) − L| < ϵ.
Note:
The limit does not require f (c) to be defined.
The limit does not exist if f (x) behaves differently from left and right.

Definition of Continuity

Definition
f is continuous at x = c if
lim f (x) = f (c)

x→c

f is continuous on [a, b] if continuous at every point in [a, b].
Intuitively, you can draw the graph of a continuous function over that
interval without lifting your pen from the paper!

Example
Show f (x) = x 3 is continuous at every c ∈ R.
Proof: It is equivalent to show that for every c,
lim f (x) = c 3

x→c

Notice that
|f (x) − f (c)| = |x 3 − c 3 | = |(x − c)(x 2 + xc + c 2 )|
If |x − c| < 1, then
|x 2 + xc + c 2 | ≤ |x|2 + |x||c| + |c|2 ≤ (|c| + 1)2 + |c|(|c| + 1) + c 2 =: M
To guarantee |x 3 − c 3 | < ε, choose
δ = min{1, ε/M}
This completes the proof.

Continuity Laws and Theorems

Continuity Laws: If f , g continuous on interval, b constant:
bf (x) is continuous
f (x) + g (x) is continuous
f (x)g (x) is continuous
f (x)/g (x) is continuous, provided g (x) ̸= 0 on the interval
f (g (x)) is continuous, provided that the composite function f (g (x))
is defined on the interval
Why are the continuity laws true? How can you prove them?

Intermediate Value Theorem

Theorem
If f continuous on [a, b] and k between f (a) and f (b), there exists c s.t.
f (c) = k.
Example: Show that f (x) = x 3 + x − 1 has a root in [0, 1].
Compute f (0) = 03 + 0 − 1 = −1
Compute f (1) = 13 + 1 − 1 = 1
0 lies between f (0) = −1 and f (1) = 1
By the Intermediate Value Theorem, ∃c ∈ [0, 1] such that f (c) = 0
Conclusion: f (x) has at least one root in [0, 1].

If this limit exists, f is differentiable at a.

Tangent Line Approximation

The derivative of a function f at point A can be interpreted as the slope of
the tangent line to the graph of the function at A.

Definition
Suppose f is differentiable at a. Then, for values of x near a, the tangent
line approximation of f (x) is
f (x) ≈ f (a) + f ′ (a)(x − a)
The expression f (a) + f ′ (a)(x − a) is called the local linearization of f
near x = a.

approximation to f for x near 4. What does a table of values for
E (x)/(x − 4) suggest about limx→4 E (x)/(x − 4)?

Make another table to see that E (x) ≈ k(x − 4)2 . Estimate the value
of k. Check that a possible value is k = f ′′ (4)/2.

Positive and Negative Derivative

Theorem
1

If f ′ (x) > 0 on an interval, then f (x) is increasing on that interval.

2

If f ′ (x) < 0 on an interval, then f (x) is decreasing on that interval.

3

If f ′ (x) = 0 on an interval, then f (x) is constant on that interval.

Mean Value Theorem

Theorem
If f is continuous on a ≤ x ≤ b and differentiable on a < x < b, then
there exists a number c, with a < c < b, such that
f ′ (c) =

f (b) − f (a)
b−a

In other words, f (b) − f (a) = f ′ (c)(b − a).

Second Derivative and Concavity

1

2

If f ′′ > 0 on an interval, then f ′ is increasing over that interval, so the
graph of f is concave up.
If f ′′ < 0 on an interval, then f ′ is decreasing over that, so the graph
of f is concave down.

The converse of the above statements are NOT true! Think f (x) = x 4 .

Second Derivative and Concavity

So, for a general function f twice differentiable:
If the graph of f is concave up, then f ′′ ≥ 0
If the graph of f is concave down, then f ′′ ≤ 0 .

Optimization: Local Extrema

Let a be a point in the domain of a differentiable function f . Then
f has a local maximum at a if f (a) ≥ f (x) for all x near a.
f has a local minimum at a if f (a) ≤ f (x) for all x near a.
We use the term extrema to refer to both maxima and minima.

All local extrema occur either at the end points of the domain or at the
critical points.

The First Derivative Test
Let x0 be a critical point of a continuous function f .
If f ′ changes from positive to negative at x0 , then f has a local
maximum.
If f ′ changes from negative to positive at x0 , then f has a local
minimum.

The Second Derivative Test

All local extrema occur either at the end points of the domain or at the
critical points.

The Second Derivative Test:
Let x0 be a critical point of a continuous function f .
If f ′ (x0 ) = 0 and f ′′ (x0 ) > 0 then f has a local minimum at x0 .
If f ′ (x0 ) = 0 and f ′′ (x0 ) < 0 then f has a local maximum at x0 .
If f ′ (x0 ) = 0 and f ′′ (x0 ) = 0 then the test is inconclusive.

Local vs. Global Extrema

A global maximum of f is the greatest value of f over its domain
(or a specified interval).
A global minimum is the least value of f over its domain (or a
specified interval).
Local extrema only describe behavior near a point, while global
extrema compare values over the entire interval/domain.

Extreme Value Theorem

Theorem
If f is continuous on a closed finite interval [a, b], then f is guaranteed to
have both a global maximum and a global minimum on that interval.
Endpoints a and b are possible locations for global extrema.
Critical points in (a, b) are also candidates.

Why Hypotheses Matter

Let us draw the graph of g (x) = x1 . Does g have a global maximum
over the interval 0 < x ≤ 1?
Let us draw the graph of h(x) = x 2 . Does h have a global maximum
over the interval 0 ≤ x < ∞?

AI503 Shan Shan

Continuity and differentiation

Lecture 2

Why Hypotheses Matter

g (x) = x1 on 0 < x ≤ 1 does not have a global maximum (domain
not closed).
h(x) = x 2 on 0 ≤ x < ∞ does not have a global maximum (domain
not bounded).
Both fail the Extreme Value Theorem assumptions.
